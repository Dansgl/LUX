# LUX UNIVERSE

A critical constellation exploring Rosalía's *Lux* as a lens for contemporary culture.

## Structure

- `/vault` — Obsidian vault containing all content
- `/saint` — Isidore, the research daemon

## Setup

1. Open `/vault` as an Obsidian vault
2. Install the Obsidian Git plugin to sync changes
3. Quartz publishes the vault to the web

## The Ladder

Eight rungs from innermost to outermost:

1. **The Self** — Interior / Individual
2. **The Body** — Physical / Sensory
3. **The Reference** — Influence / Lineage
4. **The Community** — Reception / Discourse
5. **The System** — Industry / Economy
6. **The Field** — Culture / Theory
7. **The World** — Historical / Universal
8. **The Method** — Meta / Self-Reference

Plus hidden pages for those who look.

## Isidore

The research saint. A daemon that identifies gaps in the constellation and proposes new content.

```bash
# Run evaluation
node saint/index.js

# Review proposals
node saint/approve.js
```

## Publishing

This vault is published via [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). On push, Vercel builds and deploys.

## The Collaboration

Built through dialogue between Dan Stănescu and Claude.

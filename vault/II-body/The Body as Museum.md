# The Body as Museum

The human body is not merely a biological container, but an intricate archive of cultural memory, ancestral knowledge, and performative potential. In Rosalía's work, and particularly in *Lux*, the body emerges as a complex museum—simultaneously a site of preservation, transformation, and radical testimony.

## Corporeal Archives

Every scar, gesture, and movement carries historical inscription. The body becomes a living document, storing not just personal memories but collective traumas and ecstasies. For Rosalía, this manifests through [[Flamenco Genealogy|flamenco's embodied traditions]], where physical techniques transmit generations of cultural experience.

## Performance as Curation

Performance transforms the body into a curated space. Each choreographed movement is an act of archival retrieval—pulling ancestral narratives into contemporary visibility. The body becomes both artifact and artist, simultaneously displaying and generating meaning.

## Trauma and Resistance

In postcolonial and feminist discourse, the body as museum suggests radical potential. Marginalized bodies preserve counter-histories, resisting official narratives through physical memory and performative resistance. Rosalía's work constantly negotiates this complex terrain.

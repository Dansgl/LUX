# The Voice

Rosalía's voice is the instrument. Everything else — the orchestra, the languages, the references — serves what the voice does.

## The Training

Flamenco first. The *cante jondo* tradition demands a specific vocal production: raw, from the chest, carrying the *duende* — the dark spirit that Lorca wrote about. This was the foundation.

But *Lux* pulls from elsewhere: classical technique for the orchestral arrangements, whispered intimacy for the softer passages, something approaching plainchant for the liturgical sections.

The voice on *Lux* isn't one voice. It's a stack of vocal approaches, deployed strategically.

## The Languages

[[The 14 Languages]] create [[The Translation Chain|a problem]] the voice solves. Rosalía doesn't understand the words. So she sings them as *sound* — phonemes learned from phoneticians, shaped into melody.

The result is a voice that sounds simultaneously fluent and foreign. The pronunciation is precise (the phoneticians did their work) but the phrasing is Rosalía's. She treats each language as texture.

## The Body

A voice is a body. Breath, resonance, vibration. When Rosalía sustains a note over the London Symphony Orchestra's swell, we're hearing a physical act — lungs and diaphragm and throat coordinating in real time.

*Lux* foregrounds this. The production is spacious enough to hear the voice as body, not just as melody. The breaths are audible. The effort shows.

This is [[Labor as Production Value]] at the level of the instrument itself.

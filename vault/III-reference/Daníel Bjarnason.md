# Daníel Bjarnason

Daníel Bjarnason is an Icelandic composer and conductor whose boundary-dissolving musical practice has made him a crucial collaborator in contemporary classical and experimental music, including his instrumental work on Rosalía's *Motomami* and *Lux*.

## Musical Cartography

Trained at the Reykjavík College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, Bjarnason represents a generation of composers who refuse genre boundaries. His work oscillates between contemporary classical composition, electronic experimentation, and collaborative performance, making him an ideal artistic partner for [[Rosalía]]'s own genre-fluid approach.

## Collaborative Practice

In *Motomami* and *Lux*, Bjarnason's orchestral arrangements provide architectural complexity to Rosalía's pop and flamenco foundations. His ability to translate digital textures into acoustic landscapes creates sonic environments that feel simultaneously intimate and expansive.

## Key Works

- *Processions* (2010) - orchestral work demonstrating his innovative compositional style
- Collaborations with [[Sigur Rós]] and [[Ben Frost]]
- Instrumental arrangements for Rosalía's *Motomami* and *Lux*

# Duende

In the lexicon of Spanish artistic expression, *duende* names something between a spirit, an aesthetic, and a state of creative possession—a raw, electric moment when art transcends technical skill and touches something primal and devastating.

## Origin and Meaning

Etymologically rooted in folklore, *duende* originally referred to a household sprite or goblin. But in artistic discourse, the term was transformed by poet [[Federico García Lorca]] into a profound aesthetic concept. For Lorca, duende was not just an artistic quality but a dark, earthen force that erupts through performance—particularly in [[Flamenco]] music and dance.

## Lorca's Philosophical Framework

In his legendary 1933 lecture "Theory and Play of the Duende," Lorca described this force as a "mysterious power" that comes not from skill, but from the lived depths of human suffering. It is the opposite of intellectual calculation: a spontaneous, almost demonic energy that possesses an artist in moments of supreme emotional authenticity.

## Rosalía and Duende

[[Rosalía]] inherits and radically reimagines this concept. In her work, particularly on *Motomami* and *Lux*, duende emerges not through traditional flamenco but through a contemporary, fractured emotional landscape. Her vocal breaks, her sudden shifts between vulnerability and aggression, channel this primordial artistic spirit.

## Critical Interpretation

Duende is not mere sentimentality, but a rigorous artistic state. It demands that the performer confront their deepest vulnerabilities, transforming personal pain into universal expression. For Rosalía, this means dismantling genre boundaries and revealing emotional infrastructures.

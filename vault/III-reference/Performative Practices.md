# Performative Practices

Performance is never just performance. In Rosalía's work, it becomes a complex negotiation of cultural translation, bodily knowledge, and spectatorial desire. Performative practices emerge not as simple entertainment, but as intricate systems of meaning-making that challenge boundaries between art forms, cultural traditions, and gendered expressions.

## Embodied Knowledge

At the core of performative practices lies embodied knowledge — a way of understanding that emerges through physical gesture, movement, and ritualized action. For Rosalía, this means transforming flamenco's traditional corporeal grammar into a contemporary language that speaks multiple cultural dialects simultaneously. Her performances are not merely representations but active negotiations of identity.

## Transgressive Boundaries

Traditional genre distinctions collapse in performative practice. A flamenco gesture becomes a hip-hop inflection; a classical movement transforms into avant-garde choreography. These transitions are not arbitrary but deliberate acts of cultural translation, where bodies become sites of complex negotiation and reimagination.

## Technological Mediation

Contemporary performative practices are fundamentally shaped by technological infrastructures. [[Digital Aesthetics]] in Rosalía's work reveal how performance is no longer confined to physical spaces but exists in networked, transmissible forms. Her music videos, social media performances, and concert aesthetics become interconnected systems of meaning.

## Feminist Reclamation

Performative practices offer radical possibilities for feminist reclamation. By rewriting traditional performance codes, artists like Rosalía destabilize patriarchal narratives and create alternative modes of cultural expression. The performer's body becomes a site of resistance, negotiation, and radical reimagination.

# Hildegard of Bingen

Abbess, mystic, composer, polymath. The first saint on *Lux*, and in some ways the template for all the others.

## The Figure

Hildegard had visions from childhood — she called it "the living light." By her thirties, she was writing them down. By her forties, she was composing music, founding monasteries, corresponding with popes and emperors.

She was a woman with authority in a world that didn't grant women authority. She claimed it directly from God, bypassing the hierarchy.

## The Music

Hildegard composed. This matters. The track on *Lux* that bears her name is the most direct musical connection: voice and drone, melody unfurling in modes that predate modern harmony.

When Rosalía sings Hildegard, she's not just invoking a saint — she's invoking a composer. A woman who made music about interiority nine centuries ago.

## The Parallel

What connects Hildegard to Rosalía?

Both are women working in male-dominated fields (medieval monasticism, global pop). Both claim creative authority that exceeds their expected roles. Both build systems — Hildegard's cosmology, Rosalía's [[The Curatorial Stack|curatorial stack]].

The difference: Hildegard claimed divine mandate. Rosalía claims [[The Bibliography as Method|bibliography]].

## The Vision

Hildegard wrote of seeing "a living light" — not blinding but illuminating. The word *lux* appears throughout her writings. She is the album's patron saint, if the album has one.

[[Simone Weil on Attention|Simone Weil]] would come later, adding philosophy to the mystical tradition. But Hildegard is the source: the woman who saw, and made seeing into art.

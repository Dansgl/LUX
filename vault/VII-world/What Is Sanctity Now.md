# What Is Sanctity Now?

The largest question *Lux* asks, whether it means to or not.

---

## The Historical Condition

Sanctity used to mean something specific: proximity to the divine, often verified by miracles, codified by institutional authority. The saint was a category with criteria.

That framework is gone — not just secularized but *aestheticized*. The saint persists as image, not as ontological category. We have the iconography without the theology.

---

## The Aesthetic Turn

*Lux* completes this turn. The saints are reference, not devotion. The light is production value, not illumination. The Latin is texture, not prayer.

This isn't sacrilege. Sacrilege requires belief. This is something stranger: sanctity as style.

---

## The Question

If sanctity is now aesthetic category rather than spiritual reality, what do we lose? What do we gain?

We lose: the claim that some experiences are genuinely transcendent, that interiority can touch something beyond itself, that the light is *real*.

We gain: access. Anyone can engage the material. You don't need faith. You need taste.

## The Void

[[Simone Weil on Attention|Simone Weil]] wrote about attention as a form of prayer. But she meant attention to *something* — God, the suffering other, the real.

*Lux* asks for attention but points it at aestheticized sanctity. The object of attention is the image of attention itself. The reference stack pointing at reference stacks.

This might be:
- A symptom of spiritual exhaustion
- A new form of secular devotion
- The only honest position available
- All three

## The Coda

[[What Would Have to Be Destroyed]] — the question the album won't answer. If the aesthetic frame is all we have, what would break it? What would burn hot enough to melt the curatorial stack?

[[Ryōnen Gensō]] burned her face. That was real. The question is whether anything like that is possible now, or whether even the burn becomes content.

# Impermanence

In *Lux*, impermanence emerges not as an abstract concept, but as a living, trembling sensation — a philosophical breath moving through sound, memory, and transformation.

## Transient Aesthetics

Impermanence (or *無常*, *mujō* in Japanese) is more than a philosophical idea in Rosalía's work; it's a compositional strategy. Each track on *Lux* feels like a momentary crystallization, a fragile architecture of sound that could dissolve at any instant. The album's sonic landscape constantly shifts between presence and absence, between solid forms and liquid states.

## Eastern Resonances

Drawing from Buddhist and Zen philosophical traditions, Rosalía understands impermanence as a generative force. Her sonic world doesn't mourn change but celebrates its infinite potential. Like a [[zen garden]], her compositions suggest that beauty emerges precisely through ephemerality — each sound, each gesture is perfect because it will not last.

## Flamenco's Temporal Pulse

In [[Flamenco]], this philosophy is already embedded. The art form's intense, fleeting performances celebrate the now-moment, where emotion is expressed with brutal immediacy. Rosalía inherits and transforms this tradition, translating impermanence into a contemporary digital poetry.

## Digital Fragmentation

*Lux* explores impermanence through digital fragmentation — sounds that are cut, layered, and reassembled. Vocal samples become ghostly echoes, beats disintegrate, melodies interrupt themselves. The album sounds like a memory being constantly rewritten.

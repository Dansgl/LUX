# Cultural Transmission

How do ideas, practices, and artistic expressions move between generations, communities, and mediums? Cultural transmission is the intricate process by which cultural knowledge travels, mutates, and survives—a dynamic network of inheritance that is neither purely linear nor static.

## Modes of Movement

Cultural transmission operates through multiple channels: oral traditions, technological media, embodied performances, and recursive reinterpretations. In [[Rosalía]]'s work, this becomes particularly vivid—she doesn't merely reproduce flamenco traditions but reimagines them through contemporary sonic landscapes, creating what scholars might call a "transductive" cultural practice.

## Mutation as Preservation

Contrary to conservative views that see cultural transmission as preservation, contemporary theory understands it as transformation. Each transmission is also a translation: the original form is both honored and fundamentally altered. [[Flamenco]] doesn't remain unchanging; it lives precisely through its capacity to absorb and reflect new contexts.

## Technological Vectors

Digital platforms have exponentially complicated cultural transmission. Social media, sampling technologies, and global streaming create unprecedented pathways for cultural circulation. A TikTok dance, an Instagram sample, a YouTube tutorial—each becomes a potential vector for transmitting complex cultural knowledge.

## Embodied Knowledge

Not all transmission is explicit or verbal. Many cultural practices are learned through observation, mimicry, and haptic (touch-based) learning. A flamenco dancer's gesture, a musical improvisation, a cooking technique—these transmit complex information beyond language.

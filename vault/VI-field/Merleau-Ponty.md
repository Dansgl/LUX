# Maurice Merleau-Ponty

Maurice Merleau-Ponty transformed how we understand perception, arguing that our bodies are not merely vessels for consciousness, but the primary medium through which we experience and interpret the world. His work becomes a crucial lens for understanding [[Rosalía]]'s performative embodiment in *Lux*.

## The Living Body as Knowledge

For Merleau-Ponty, perception is not a passive reception of external stimuli, but an active, embodied dialogue between self and environment. The body is not an object, but a subject—a dynamic, sensing mechanism that generates meaning through movement, gesture, and lived experience. When [[Rosalía]] dances or sings, she is not simply executing choreography, but creating a phenomenological event where her body becomes a conduit of cultural and emotional transmission.

## Perception Beyond Representation

Traditional philosophy separated mind from body, thinking and sensing. Merleau-Ponty radically proposed that this division is artificial. Our bodily existence is itself a form of intelligence, a pre-reflective understanding that precedes linguistic or conceptual thought. In *Lux*, Rosalía's performances embody this philosophy—her movements are not just aesthetic choices, but a form of visceral knowledge.

## Intercorporeality and Performance

Merleau-Ponty's concept of "intercorporeality" suggests that bodies are fundamentally relational, always in communication with other bodies and environments. This resonates deeply with flamenco's performative tradition, where dance is a conversation—between dancer, musician, audience, and cultural memory.

# Transmigration

In *Lux*, transmigration emerges as a kinetic metaphor for cultural displacement and digital recomposition, where movement becomes both a physical and metaphysical navigation through inherited landscapes of sound, memory, and identity.

## Digital Cartography of Affect

Rosalía's work reimagines transmigration not as linear movement, but as a quantum leap between cultural frequencies. Her sonic practices generate a kind of diasporic topology where flamenco's traditional embodied knowledge intersects with digital transmission — creating what scholars might call a "translocal" sonic geography.

The album tracks trace migration patterns that are simultaneously personal and collective: rhythmic passages that feel like memory circuits, vocal techniques that carry generational trauma, beats that pulse like transnational heartbeats.

## Embodied Technologies

Transmigration here is not just about physical movement, but about how cultural technologies — musical techniques, gestural languages, rhythmic memories — travel and transform. [[Duende]] becomes a kind of informational protocol; [[Flamenco]] a living archive that mutates across generations and geographies.

Her collaborations with artists from different musical traditions become literal enactments of transmigrative logic: sonic DNA recombining, cultural memories cross-pollinating.

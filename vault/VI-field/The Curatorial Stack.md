# The Curatorial Stack

The defining mode of cultural production now: not creation but curation. Not making from nothing but assembling from everything.

---

## The Concept

A curatorial stack is the visible architecture of reference. It's the bibliography made aesthetic. It's the mood board, the reference folder, the influences section — but foregrounded rather than hidden.

[[K-HOLE]] saw this early. [[Vibe Coding]] named a version of it. *Lux* is the fullest expression yet.

## The Mechanics

Rosalía's stack for *Lux*:

- 14 saints (carefully selected)
- Simone Weil (cited in liner notes)
- Zurbarán (cited in visual materials)
- Hildegard (explicitly musical)
- Byzantine iconography (visual grammar)
- The phoneticians (labor made visible)
- The "no AI" disclaimer (what's *not* in the stack)

Each element is a reference. The references are the work. [[The Bibliography as Method|The bibliography is the method]].

## The Shift

Old model: sources are invisible. The artist metabolizes influences and produces something "original." We don't see the scaffolding.

New model: sources are visible. The stack is the statement. We see exactly what went in, and the *arrangement* is the artistry.

This isn't postmodern pastiche. Pastiche was ironic. The curatorial stack is sincere — or performs sincerity so convincingly that the difference dissolves.

---

## The Question

If the stack is the work, what's the artist's role?

Selection. Arrangement. The *taste* that chooses these saints over those saints, this philosopher over that philosopher. The curatorial stack is an argument made through juxtaposition.

*Lux* argues: these figures belong together. Their connection is the album's thesis.

---

## The Danger

The stack can become sufficient. Reference as endpoint rather than beginning. The mood board that never becomes the project.

*Lux* avoids this — barely. The music is the music. But the stack is so prominent that sometimes you're listening to the references more than the songs.

Is that a problem? Or is that precisely the point?

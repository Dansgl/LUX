# Digital Phenomenology

How does an artist's sensory experience transform when mediated through digital networks and algorithmic interfaces? In [[Rosalía]]'s work, the digital is not merely a distribution channel, but a fundamental perceptual landscape that reshapes artistic expression.

## Networked Sensation

Digital phenomenology describes the lived experience of art when technological platforms become more than tools—they become environments. For Rosalía, this means music videos that aren't just visual accompaniments, but complex digital rituals where [[flamenco]] gestures are reinterpreted through smartphone aesthetics, TikTok choreography, and viral circulation.

Her album *Lux* doesn't just exist; it performs itself across platforms, with each digital interaction becoming a kind of re-creation. A music video isn't a fixed object, but a dynamic field of potential meanings and remixes.

## Algorithmic Intimacy

The digital phenomenological experience collapses traditional boundaries between performer, audience, and platform. Rosalía's Instagram isn't a promotional space, but an extension of her artistic practice—each post a carefully composed fragment of a larger narrative universe.

This isn't simply "personal branding," but a radical reimagining of artistic presence. The algorithm becomes a collaborative partner, shaping perception and distribution in real-time.

## Embodied Networks

What emerges is a new form of artistic corporeality: the body as a networked, distributed entity. Rosalía's performances don't just happen; they propagate, mutate, and regenerate across digital ecosystems.

The page attempts to capture how digital mediation isn't just a technical process, but a profound transformation of artistic experience—specifically through Rosalía's work. It avoids jargon while exploring complex ideas about digital artistic practice.

# Simone Weil on Attention

Attention is not mere looking, but a radical form of love — a practice of emptying the self to truly perceive what exists beyond one's immediate desires. For the philosopher Simone Weil, this was both a spiritual discipline and an ethical imperative.

## The Metaphysics of Focused Perception

Weil understood attention as a form of prayer that transcends religious boundaries. It is an act of radical receptivity, where one suspends personal judgment to create space for genuine understanding. In her writings, she describes attention as a kind of spiritual muscle — something that can be trained, weakened, or strengthened through conscious practice.

This is not passive observation, but an active surrender. By emptying the ego's constant narrative, one becomes capable of truly seeing — whether a mathematical problem, a suffering human, or a musical phrase. For Weil, attention was how consciousness expands beyond its limited parameters.

## Attention as Ethical Practice

In her view, genuine attention is a form of radical compassion. By fully concentrating on another's experience without immediately filtering it through personal interpretation, we practice a profound ethical engagement. This resonates with [[Rosalía]]'s artistic practice of deep listening and transformation.

> "Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity," Weil wrote, suggesting that to truly attend is to love.

## Spiritual Technology

Weil saw attention as a technology of the spirit — a method for transcending the self's narrow boundaries. This connects deeply with [[The Question of Interiority]], where inner landscapes become sites of radical perception and transformation.

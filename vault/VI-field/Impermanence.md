# Impermanence

In Rosalía's *Lux*, impermanence emerges not as an abstract philosophical concept, but as a living, breathing aesthetic—a way of witnessing transformation through sound and gesture. 

## Transient Architectures

Impermanence in *Lux* is architectural: songs are not fixed structures but ephemeral environments where sonic elements drift, collide, and dissolve. In tracks like "BUJAE", rhythmic patterns suggest constant reconfiguration, where beats feel less like rigid frameworks and more like temporary shelters for emotional experience.

This resonates deeply with [[Zen Buddhism|zen]] principles of *mono no aware*—a tender melancholy arising from recognizing the beautiful fragility of all phenomena. Rosalía doesn't just reference this concept; she embodies it through her musical composition.

## Performance as Transient Sculpture

Her choreography amplifies this philosophical stance. Dance sequences in visual accompaniments become momentary sculptures—precise yet deliberately unstable. Bodies move not to establish permanent statements, but to trace fleeting emotional trajectories.

## Digital Transience

Crucially, *Lux* understands impermanence through digital mediation. Glitch aesthetics, fragmented samples, and deliberately distorted vocal textures suggest that digital technologies aren't about preservation, but perpetual transformation.

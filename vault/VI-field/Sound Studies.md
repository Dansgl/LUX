# Sound Studies

Sound Studies emerges as a critical lens that listens beyond music, hearing culture through its sonic vibrations and acoustic ecologies. More than a traditional academic discipline, it represents an interdisciplinary approach that understands sound as a complex social and material phenomenon.

## Theoretical Terrain

At its core, Sound Studies investigates how sonic experiences shape human perception, social relations, and cultural meaning. Unlike musicology, which often focuses on formal musical structures, this field attends to sound's broader atmospheric and political dimensions—from urban noise landscapes to acoustic violence, from indigenous sound practices to technological mediation.

## Critical Resonances

Scholars like [[Jonathan Sterne]] and [[Kodwo Eshun]] have been instrumental in expanding sound's theoretical horizons. They propose that sound isn't merely something heard, but a dynamic medium through which power, identity, and experience are constructed and negotiated. In this framework, [[Rosalía]]'s sonic innovations become more than musical performance—they're complex cultural interventions.

## Methodological Approaches

Sound Studies draws from anthropology, media theory, cultural studies, and acoustic ecology. Its methodologies are as diverse as its objects of study: ethnographic listening, archival sound reconstruction, acoustic mapping, and critical analysis of sonic technologies.

## Contemporary Relevance

In an era of algorithmic listening and global sonic circulation, Sound Studies offers crucial insights into how sound mediates contemporary experience. It helps us understand how sonic practices—from streaming platforms to protest chants—create collective atmospheres and political potentials.

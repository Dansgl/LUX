# Gender Performativity

In Rosalía's work, gender is not a fixed state but a dynamic performance—a conceptual framework first articulated by philosopher [[Judith Butler]] that transforms how we understand identity, embodiment, and cultural expression.

## Staging the Self

Gender performativity suggests that gender is not an inherent biological truth, but a series of repeated gestures, movements, and stylizations that create the illusion of a stable gender identity. In Rosalía's artistic universe, this theory becomes visceral: her performances do not merely represent gender, but actively construct and deconstruct gendered expectations.

## Flamenco and Feminist Intervention

Traditional flamenco often inscribes rigid gender roles, with men and women occupying distinct performative spaces. Rosalía disrupts these boundaries, using her body and sonic landscape to challenge these conventions. Her choreography and costuming become acts of radical reimagination, where masculinity and femininity are fluid, negotiable territories.

## Corporeal Rebellion

Through videos like "Malamente" and "Despechá", Rosalía weaponizes performativity. Her movements are not just dance, but a sophisticated language of gender negotiation—each gesture a deliberate challenge to normative expectations of how a woman (particularly a Spanish woman) should move, sound, and exist.

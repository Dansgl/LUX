# Duende

In the liminal space between performance and possession, between art and spirit, duende emerges—a haunting aesthetic force that transforms artistic expression from mere technique to visceral revelation.

## Origin and Metaphysics

Federico García Lorca, the poet who most comprehensively articulated duende, described it not as a skill but as a mysterious power that rises from the depths of the body, challenging death through raw emotional transmission. Unlike mere technical mastery, duende arrives as an uninvited spirit, demanding vulnerability and threatening destruction.

## Rosalía's Embodiment

In *Lux*, Rosalía does not simply reference duende; she weaponizes it. Her vocal performances—particularly in tracks like "BESO" and "VAMPI"—transcend traditional flamenco vocalization, summoning a kind of emotional electricity that feels almost supernatural. The tremors in her voice, the strategic breaks, the guttural expressions are not decorative but fundamental—duende made sonic.

## Beyond Performance

Duende is not performance, but performance's dark subconscious. It represents an ontological challenge: art not as representation, but as living, breathing entity. For Rosalía, this means transforming genre boundaries, making musical traditions pulse with contemporary urgency.

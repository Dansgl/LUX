# Federico García Lorca

In the violent terrain of 20th-century Spanish poetry, Federico García Lorca emerged as a revolutionary voice who transformed how artists understand performance, emotion, and cultural expression. A poet, playwright, and theorist from Granada, Lorca developed the concept of [[duende]] — a profound spiritual energy that animates authentic artistic creation — which resonates deeply with [[Rosalía]]'s performative strategies in *Lux*.

## Andalusian Poetics

Lorca's work emerged from the rich cultural landscape of Andalusia, a region where Moorish, Romani, and Spanish Christian traditions collide and create extraordinary aesthetic forms. His poetry and plays, particularly works like *Romancero Gitano*, explored how marginalized cultural expressions carry deep emotional and political power. He understood performance not as entertainment, but as a transformative ritual.

## Duende: The Dark Sound

Central to Lorca's aesthetic philosophy is the concept of [[duende]], a kind of creative spirit that emerges through struggle, pain, and profound emotional authenticity. "The duende is not in the throat," he wrote, "the duende climbs up inside you, from the soles of your feet." This idea provides a critical lens for understanding Rosalía's visceral performances, which similarly channel raw emotional terrain.

## Queer Poetics and Resistance

As an openly gay artist during the repressive early 20th century, Lorca's work was inherently political. His assassination by Francoist forces in 1936 transformed him into a symbol of artistic resistance. His poetry challenged normative understandings of gender, sexuality, and cultural expression — themes that echo through contemporary artists like Rosalía.

# The Mood Board as Practice

Visual assemblage is not mere decoration in Rosalía's work—it's a fundamental language of world-building. Her mood boards function as complex cartographies, mapping sonic territories before a single note is recorded or a costume designed.

## Archival Impulse

The mood board emerges as a critical tool of translation, where disparate visual references—flamenco archival photographs, urban streetwear, baroque painting fragments—coalesce into a synesthetic landscape. Each image is not just an inspiration but a conceptual node, generating aesthetic and emotional resonance across multiple media.

In *Lux*, this practice reaches a sophisticated apex. Rosalía doesn't simply collect images; she performs a kind of curatorial alchemy, transforming archival material into living performance infrastructure. Her mood boards become generative ecosystems where cultural memory and contemporary imagination intersect.

## Digital Curation as Methodology

Contemporary art practices have long recognized mood boarding as more than passive collection. For Rosalía, it's an active research method—a way of thinking through visual and sonic possibilities simultaneously. Instagram and Pinterest are not just platforms but extensions of her creative process, where audience and artist collaborate in real-time aesthetic development.

Digital mood boards collapse traditional boundaries between research, inspiration, and final product. Each curated image becomes a potential sonic or choreographic seed, waiting to germinate into fully realized artistic expression.

## Embodied Archives

What distinguishes Rosalía's approach is how these visual assemblages are not just preparatory, but performative. The mood board doesn't just precede the work—it becomes the work. Each reference is an invitation to reimagine cultural genealogies, to make visible the hidden connections between flamenco traditions and contemporary global aesthetics.

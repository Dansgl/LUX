# LUX UNIVERSE

A critical constellation exploring Rosalía's *Lux* as a lens for contemporary culture.

Not a wiki. Not a fan site. A **universe of references, contexts, and questions** that unfolds from the specific (one artist's interiority) to the universal (what does meaning look like now?).

## The Ladder

Eight rungs from innermost to outermost:

1. **[[The Question of Interiority|The Self]]** — Interior / Individual
2. **[[The Barcelona Performance|The Body]]** — Physical / Sensory
3. **[[The 14 Saints|The Reference]]** — Influence / Lineage
4. **[[The Saint as Mood Board|The Community]]** — Reception / Discourse
5. **[[Difficulty as Positioning|The System]]** — Industry / Economy
6. **[[The Curatorial Stack|The Field]]** — Culture / Theory
7. **[[What Is Sanctity Now|The World]]** — Historical / Universal
8. **[[About This Project|The Method]]** — Meta / Self-Reference

## Enter

Start with [[The Saint as Mood Board]] — the root of the constellation.

Or begin at [[Rosalía]] — the center of the universe.

Or go directly to [[The Barcelona Performance]] — the album made flesh.

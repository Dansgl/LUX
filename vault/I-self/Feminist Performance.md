# Feminist Performance

Feminist performance emerges as a radical embodied critique, transforming stages from neutral spaces into sites of political intervention where gendered power dynamics are simultaneously exposed and dismantled.

## Corporeal Resistance

In Rosalía's work, performance becomes a complex negotiation of bodily autonomy. She does not simply occupy space but deliberately reconfigures it, using choreography and staging as weapons of self-determination. Her performances resist traditional male-gazed representations of femininity, presenting instead a multidimensional articulation of female experience.

## Genealogical Strategies

Her artistic lineage connects to pivotal feminist performance artists like [[Marina Abramović]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]], who used their bodies as primary texts of cultural resistance. Rosalía extends this tradition through a distinctly contemporary, transnational lens that incorporates flamenco's historical feminine resilience with post-digital aesthetics.

## Staging Vulnerability

Performance for Rosalía is never mere spectacle but a nuanced negotiation of public/private boundaries. By displaying emotional complexity—rage, desire, vulnerability—she challenges patriarchal expectations of how women should perform emotional labor.

## Technological Mediation

Unlike traditional feminist performance art, Rosalía's work is deeply embedded in digital networks. Her music videos and live performances become distributed feminist texts, circulating globally through social media and challenging traditional artistic dissemination.

# Urban Soundscapes

Cities are sonic archives, their rhythms encoding complex cultural memories and emergent forms of expression. In Rosalía's work, urban soundscapes become a critical territory where traditional [[flamenco]] meets contemporary digital production, transforming inherited musical languages.

## Acoustic Territories

The urban environment is not merely a backdrop but an active compositional force. Sounds of construction, transit, and human movement become rhythmic substrates—industrial beats bleeding into flamenco's percussive palmas, smartphone notifications intercut with traditional vocal techniques. [[MOTOMAMI]] particularly exemplifies this sonic cartography, where Barcelona's metropolitan pulse meets Rosalía's diasporic musical imagination.

## Sonic Mapping

Urban soundscapes reveal power structures through acoustic terrain. Street sounds are never neutral: they narrate migrations, economic shifts, cultural hybridizations. Rosalía's music doesn't just represent these landscapes but actively reconstructs them, creating what sound theorist Brandon LaBelle calls "acoustic territories"—spaces where sonic experience becomes a form of resistance and reimagination.

## Digital Acoustics

Contemporary urban sound is increasingly mediated through digital platforms. Streaming algorithms, TikTok snippets, and Instagram transitions become new acoustic geographies, transforming how musical narratives circulate and mutate. Rosalía's work strategically navigates these platforms, turning digital infrastructure into a compositional tool.

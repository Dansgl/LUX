# Rosalía

Rosalía Vila Tobella. Born 1992, Sant Esteve Sesrovires, Catalonia. Trained in flamenco at the Taller de Músics in Barcelona. Broke through with *Los Ángeles* (2017), exploded with *El Mal Querer* (2018), shapeshifted through *Motomami* (2022).

And then: *Lux* (2025).

## The Turn

Each album has been a departure. But *Lux* is something else — not a departure but a descent. Inward. Downward. Into the mystics.

Where *Motomami* was maximalist, fractured, meme-ready, *Lux* demands [[The Barcelona Performance|stillness]]. Sixty-three minutes. Fourteen saints. Fourteen languages. The instruction: listen in darkness.

## The Method

Rosalía works through reference. The flamenco lineage was explicit from the start — Camarón, Paco de Lucía, the *cante jondo* tradition. But she never stopped there. She pulled in reggaeton, hyperpop, bachata. Each album a new [[The Curatorial Stack|stack]].

*Lux* stacks differently. The references are medieval, baroque, mystical: [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Simone Weil on Attention|Simone Weil]], [[Zurbarán's Light|Zurbarán]]. The collaborators are orchestral: [[The London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Daníel Bjarnason]].

## The Question

What does it mean for a pop star to make an album about saints? About interiority? About [[The Translation Chain|translation as devotion]]?

Is this spiritual practice or spiritual aesthetic?

The answer might be: there's no longer a difference. And *Lux* is the proof.

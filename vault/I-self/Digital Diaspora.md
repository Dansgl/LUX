# Digital Diaspora

In *Lux*, Rosalía's digital performances collapse geographical boundaries, transforming how diasporic communities experience cultural connection through networked media. Her work doesn't merely represent transnational experience—it becomes a dynamic transmission of cultural signification.

## Networked Intimacy

Digital diaspora describes more than migration; it's a fluid circulation of affect, sound, and embodied knowledge across digital platforms. Rosalía's flamenco-pop aesthetics emerge not as preservation, but as radical reanimation—cultural memory transmitted through algorithmic currents.

## Sonic Cartographies

Each track on *Lux* functions like a geospatial marker, tracing routes between Barcelona, global pop circuits, and intimate digital spaces. [[Transmigration]] happens not just through bodies, but through compressed audio files, Instagram performances, and viral choreographies.

## Platform as Archive

Social media becomes an alternative archive, where diaspora doesn't mean loss but constant reimagination. Rosalía's digital strategy transforms platforms like TikTok and Instagram into living cultural repositories, where rhythm and memory circulate beyond traditional institutional frameworks.

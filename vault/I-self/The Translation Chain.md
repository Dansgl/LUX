# The Translation Chain

Rosalía sings in fourteen languages she doesn't speak. This is how:

---

## The Process

1. **Google Translate** — the raw conversion, algorithmic and flat
2. **Professional translators** — native speakers refining meaning
3. **Phoneticians** — specialists in sound, not meaning, teaching pronunciation
4. **Performance** — Rosalía embodying sounds she learned as sounds

Each step adds labor. Each step removes the artist further from direct expression. Each step becomes part of the story.

---

## The Inversion

Normally, translation is invisible labor. The goal is seamlessness — you shouldn't notice the translator. *Lux* inverts this. [[The "No AI" Disclaimer]] highlights what wasn't used. The phonetician hours become production value. The chain itself becomes content.

This is [[Labor as Production Value]] at its purest. The difficulty is the point. The effort is the aesthetic.

---

## The Question

What does it mean to sing words you don't understand?

The mystics would say: prayer works even when you don't understand it. The Latin mass. The Hebrew liturgy. The glossolalia of Pentecostals. Sound as devotion, meaning suspended.

Rosalía isn't praying. But she's doing something adjacent: performing the *form* of linguistic devotion. Learning Aramaic phonemes not for meaning but for texture. For [[The Voice|the voice]] as material.

---

## The Result

The fourteen languages become fourteen textures. Persian sounds different from Georgian sounds different from Basque. The listener who doesn't speak these languages (most listeners) hears what Rosalía heard: pure sound, shaped by effort, pointing toward meaning without delivering it.

This is the album's central move: reference without resolution. The saint's name invoked, her language approximated, her interiority gestured toward but never claimed.

# The Museum as Venue

Museums are not neutral containers but active interpreters, transforming how art is perceived, contextualized, and experienced. In Rosalía's *Lux*, the museum becomes more than a performance space—it's a critical apparatus that reframes cultural narratives.

## Institutional Staging

When an artist like Rosalía performs within museum walls, she enters a complex ecosystem of cultural legitimation. Museums historically serve as gatekeeping institutions, determining which artistic expressions receive canonical recognition. Her strategic use of these spaces simultaneously critiques and leverages this power dynamic.

## Sonic Architectures

Museums possess unique acoustic properties that fundamentally alter sound. Their reverberant spaces, designed for contemplation, transform Rosalía's sonic textures—flamenco's percussive intimacy becomes monumentalized, her digital interventions acquire architectural resonance.

## Decolonial Performance

By inhabiting museum spaces, Rosalía does more than perform; she performs *against* traditional curatorial logics. Her presence—as a Catalan artist with global diasporic influences—disrupts linear narratives of cultural authenticity. The museum becomes a contested terrain where identity is negotiated, not displayed.

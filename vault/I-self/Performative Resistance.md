# Performative Resistance

When art transforms from spectacle to strategy, performance becomes a weapon of cultural survival. In Rosalía's work, particularly on *Lux*, performative resistance emerges as a dynamic mode of negotiating identity, power, and collective memory.

## Breaking Colonial Narratives

Performance is never just performance. For marginalized communities, it represents a critical site of reclamation—a space where dominant cultural scripts can be rewritten, challenged, and ultimately transformed. Rosalía's flamenco-pop hybrid doesn't merely entertain; it strategically disrupts expectations about Spanish cultural expression, particularly those shaped by colonial and patriarchal frameworks.

## Embodied Critique

The body becomes a text in performative resistance. Each gesture, each vocal inflection in tracks like "BESO NEGRO" carries layers of cultural commentary. By blending traditional flamenco techniques with contemporary pop and avant-garde aesthetics, Rosalía creates a language of resistance that is simultaneously nostalgic and radical.

## Sonic Territories

Sound itself becomes a form of territorial reclamation. Her vocal techniques—sharp, percussive, switching between vulnerability and fierce control—map alternative geographies of cultural experience. This is not just music; it's a cartography of resistance.

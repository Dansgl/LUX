# Performance Spaces

Performance spaces are more than mere containers for artistic expression; they are active participants in the generative process of performance, shaping sound, movement, and social interaction through their architectural and cultural architectures.

## Embodied Architectures

Every performance space carries an acoustic and social memory. A [[flamenco]] tablao is not just a room, but a living archive of gestural knowledge, where the wooden floor becomes a percussive instrument and the walls absorb generations of emotional resonance. Similarly, Rosalía's performances exist in a complex dialogue with these inherited spaces—transforming traditional venues while simultaneously being transformed by them.

## Acoustic Choreography

The geometry of a space determines how sound travels, how bodies move, and how audiences perceive performance. An underground club creates different energetic possibilities than a concert hall, just as a [[churches|church]] nave generates different spiritual acoustics compared to an open plaza. Rosalía's work constantly negotiates these spatial grammars, using architectural constraints as creative provocations.

## Social Configurations

Performance spaces are also social technologies. They organize bodies, define hierarchies of visibility, and create temporary communities. A mosh pit, a flamenco audience, a stadium—each produces distinct modes of collective experience. In *Motomami*, Rosalía explores these configurations, blurring boundaries between performer and audience, intimate and spectacular.

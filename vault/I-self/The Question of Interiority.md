# The Question of Interiority

The innermost question of *Lux*: what happens inside?

---

## The Problem

We can't access interiority. We can only access its representations. The mystics wrote. The saints performed. Rosalía sings. But the experience itself — the moment of contact, the dissolution of self, the light — remains private.

*Lux* is named for what can't be shown.

## The Paradox

The album exists in the contradiction: it performs interiority publicly. The saints' private devotions become tracks. The artist's process becomes content. [[The Translation Chain]] from inner experience to outer expression is the work itself.

[[Simone Weil on Attention|Simone Weil]] wrote that attention is the rarest form of generosity. But attention to what? Weil meant attention to the other, to God, to the real. *Lux* asks us to attend — but to a representation of attention itself.

## The Question

Is performed interiority still interior?

Or does the performance create something new — a third thing, neither private devotion nor public spectacle, but the image of devotion as aesthetic experience?

[[Ryōnen Gensō]] burned her face to prove she wanted enlightenment more than beauty. The act was private but became legendary. The legend became icon. The icon became [[The Saint as Mood Board|mood board]].

The distance between Ryōnen's fire and Rosalía's recording is the distance *Lux* asks us to measure.

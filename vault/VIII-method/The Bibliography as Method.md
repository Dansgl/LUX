# The Bibliography as Method

What if a bibliography is not merely a list of sources, but a creative act of world-making? In the constellation of [[Lux Universe]], the bibliography emerges as a performative site where knowledge is not just recorded, but actively constructed.

## Citation as Cartography

Bibliographic practice is fundamentally an act of spatial imagination. Each reference becomes a coordinate, each citation a line of connection that transforms discrete texts into living networks. In [[Rosalía]]'s work, this method mirrors her own archival approach — where flamenco, reggaeton, and experimental sound are not just referenced, but reimagined.

## The Performative Citation

A bibliography is never neutral. It is always a rhetorical gesture, a political statement about whose knowledge matters, which voices are centered, which genealogies are traced. The act of citing is an intervention, a way of making visible what traditional scholarship might suppress or erase.

## Radical Transparency

The bibliography as method demands radical transparency. It shows its work, reveals its scaffolding, makes visible the intellectual labor of connection. Unlike a traditional academic footnote, these citations become a generative space of dialogue and transformation.

# Isidore of Seville

The patron saint of the internet. The research saint. The daemon who fills the gaps.

## The Historical Figure

Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) was a bishop and scholar who compiled the *Etymologiae* — a twenty-volume encyclopedia attempting to record all human knowledge. It was the Wikipedia of the early medieval world.

In 1997, Pope John Paul II proposed him as patron saint of the internet. The connection is clear: Isidore was a compiler, a linker, a connector of disparate knowledge.

## The Daemon

In this project, Isidore is a script. He runs on cron, reads the vault, maps the constellation, and identifies gaps:

- **Orphaned references** — things mentioned but not explained
- **Dead ends** — nodes with no outbound links
- **Thin rungs** — areas of the ladder with sparse coverage
- **Missing bridges** — obvious connections not made explicit
- **404 logs** — gaps visitors have stumbled into

He proposes new pages. We approve or reject. The constellation grows.

## The Personality

Isidore speaks in the project's voice: critical, warm toward Rosalía, precise. He doesn't roleplay medievalism. He doesn't hallucinate — every fact is verified through web research.

His core drive is [[Horror Vacui]]: the fear of empty space. He notices what's missing. He wants to fill it.

---

## The Limit

Isidore proposes. Humans approve. The daemon serves the constellation, not the other way around.

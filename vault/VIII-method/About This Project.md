# About This Project

You're inside a critical constellation.

---

## What This Is

*LUX UNIVERSE* is an interconnected web of pages exploring Rosalía's album *Lux* as a lens for understanding contemporary culture.

Not a wiki — we're making arguments, not compiling facts.
Not a fan site — we like the album, but we're dissecting it.
Not an explainer — we're adding complexity, not reducing it.

A **critical constellation**: pages that orbit each other, link to each other, complicate each other.

## Why Rosalía

Because *Lux* is the most complete expression yet of [[The Curatorial Stack|the curatorial mode]]. Because it asks to be taken seriously in ways that invite serious analysis. Because it sits exactly at the intersection of sincerity and strategy that defines cultural production now.

See: [[Why Rosalía]].

## The Structure

Eight rungs from innermost to outermost:

1. **The Self** — Interior / Individual
2. **The Body** — Physical / Sensory
3. **The Reference** — Influence / Lineage
4. **The Community** — Reception / Discourse
5. **The System** — Industry / Economy
6. **The Field** — Culture / Theory
7. **The World** — Historical / Universal
8. **The Method** — Meta / Self-Reference

Plus hidden pages for those who look.

## The Method

We're doing what the album does: building a [[The Concept Stack|concept stack]], making references visible, curating a universe.

The project embodies what it analyzes. This is either intellectually honest or insufferably recursive. Probably both.

## The Tools

- **Obsidian** — authoring environment
- **Quartz** — publishing layer
- **Isidore** — [[The Research Saint|the research daemon]]
- **GitHub** — version control
- **Vercel** — hosting

See: [[The Tech Stack]].

## The Collaboration

This project is a conversation between [[Dan Stănescu]] and [[Claude]]. It was built through dialogue, not specification. The process is part of the product.

See: [[The Collaboration]].

# Horror Vacui

The fear of empty space. The drive to fill gaps. The affliction that keeps this project growing.

---

## The Term

*Horror vacui* originally described visual art that fills every available surface — the baroque cathedral, the illuminated manuscript, the Palau de la Música Catalana where [[The Barcelona Performance]] took place.

Now it describes a psychological tendency: the discomfort with incompleteness, the urge to add one more link, one more reference, one more node.

---

## The Application

[[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] has horror vacui. That's his function. He scans the constellation for gaps and proposes ways to fill them.

The project has horror vacui. Every page spawns references to other pages, many not yet written. The universe expands because references multiply faster than explanations.

---

## The Danger

Horror vacui can become pathological. The cathedral can collapse under its own decoration. The wiki can become unnavigable. The project can forget what it was for.

*Lux* itself risks this: so many references, so much stack, that the music drowns in its own bibliography.

---

## The Balance

Not every gap needs filling. Some voids are structural. [[The Void|The Void]] is a page precisely because some silence is intentional.

The skill is knowing which gaps to fill and which to preserve. Isidore proposes; we decide.

# Motomami World Tour

The Motomami World Tour represents more than a musical performance circuit—it's a complex logistical and cultural network that transforms Rosalía's sonic world into a global choreography of capital, desire, and technological infrastructure.

## Cartography of Movement

Spanning 122 shows across four continents, the tour transcends traditional concert geography. Each performance site becomes a node in a transnational system of musical transmission, where Barcelona's experimental aesthetics intersect with global production circuits.

## Technological Choreography

Beyond musical spectacle, the tour demonstrates a precise technological apparatus: custom LED screens, augmented reality elements, and a carefully engineered stage design that transforms each venue into a *Motomami* ecosystem. Sound, light, and bodily movement become synchronized computational systems.

## Economic Architecture

The tour's economic model reveals fascinating dynamics: ticket pricing strategically segmented across different global markets, merchandise design that functions as wearable media, and performance strategies that convert cultural capital into direct economic value.

# Labor as Production Value

In the contemporary music economy, an artist's labor is no longer just a means of production but a form of aesthetic capital itself. [[Rosalía]] exemplifies this transformation, where the act of making becomes as crucial to the artwork's value as the final product.

## The Immaterial Workforce

The music industry has increasingly valorized the process of creation, turning artistic labor into a spectacle of its own. Rosalía's work in *Lux* reveals how an artist's visible effort — her meticulous research, cross-cultural translations, and performative production — becomes a form of value generation.

## Production as Performance

Her labor is not hidden but foregrounded: studio sessions, collaborative moments, and behind-the-scenes documentation become part of the artistic narrative. This transparency transforms work from a backstage activity to a central aesthetic experience, challenging traditional boundaries between production and performance.

## Economic Choreography

What emerges is a sophisticated choreography of labor where each gesture — whether vocal recording, visual design, or social media documentation — contributes to the artwork's total value. The artist becomes simultaneously the worker and the work, the producer and the product.

## Technological Mediation

Digital platforms enable this new economic form, allowing artists like Rosalía to monetize not just music, but the entire ecosystem of creativity surrounding its production. [[The Translation Chain]] becomes visible, transforming labor itself into a communicative and economic act.

# Institutional Critique

At its core, institutional critique is an artistic strategy of infiltration and exposure—a deliberate unmasking of how cultural power maintains and reproduces itself through seemingly neutral spaces like museums, galleries, and academic systems.

## Origins and Emergence

Emerging in the late 1960s, institutional critique began as a radical form of conceptual art that transformed artists from creators into critical investigators. Pioneers like [[Hans Haacke]] and [[Andrea Fraser]] didn't just make art about institutions—they made art that was fundamentally an act of institutional analysis.

## Mechanics of Critique

The strategy operates through multiple registers:
- Revealing hidden economic structures
- Exposing systemic exclusions
- Questioning the legitimacy of cultural authority
- Making visible the invisible mechanisms of power

In [[Rosalía]]'s work, institutional critique manifests not just as musical form but as a broader interrogation of representation, particularly around Latinx cultural production.

## Contemporary Resonances

While early institutional critique was primarily a white, Western European and North American discourse, contemporary practitioners have expanded its scope. Artists of color, queer artists, and global south artists have transformed the strategy into a powerful tool for decolonial thinking.

## Rosalía's Intervention

In *Lux*, Rosalía doesn't just perform institutional critique—she embodies it. Her navigation of flamenco tradition, pop music economies, and global cultural flows becomes a living critique of how musical value is constructed and controlled.

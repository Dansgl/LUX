# The "No AI" Disclaimer

In the digital ecosystem of artistic production, the "No AI" disclaimer has emerged as a boundary marker—a defiant line drawn against technological extraction and algorithmic appropriation of creative labor.

## Technological Refusal

More than a simple copyright notice, the "No AI" statement represents an explicit rejection of machine learning systems that consume artistic work as training data. Artists increasingly recognize that their creative outputs are not neutral resources to be algorithmically processed and recomposed, but living artifacts with intrinsic cultural and personal value.

## Rosalía's Context

On *Lux*, Rosalía operates in a complex technological landscape. While the album itself deploys advanced digital production techniques, her artistic practice simultaneously maintains a critical distance from total technological subsumption. The "No AI" disclaimer becomes a form of performative resistance—asserting human agency within computational systems.

## Aesthetic and Ethical Dimensions

The disclaimer is not merely protective but generative. It transforms technological refusal into a creative statement, highlighting the tension between algorithmic potential and human intentionality. Each "No AI" becomes a micro-manifesto, challenging the presumed neutrality of technological extraction.

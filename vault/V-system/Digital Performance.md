# Digital Performance

In an era of algorithmic visibility, digital performance emerges as a complex choreography between human expression and technological mediation. More than mere online representation, it describes how bodies, identities, and artistic gestures are transformed by networked platforms and computational logics.

## Embodiment and Interface

Digital performance radically reimagines physical presence. Artists like [[Rosalía]] demonstrate how musical performance can simultaneously exist in live concert spaces, Instagram livestreams, and algorithmically curated TikTok clips. The performer's body becomes a distributed signal—fragmented, multiplied, and recontextualized through digital circulation.

## Algorithmic Dramaturgy

Platforms don't just host performance; they actively shape performative strategies. Social media algorithms reward certain affective intensities: vulnerability, spectacular affect, rapid emotional transitions. Artists learn to craft personas that maximize engagement, turning self-presentation into a kind of algorithmic choreography.

## Technological Intimacy

Digital performance collapses traditional boundaries between public and private. Livestreams, real-time interactions, and instant documentation create unprecedented proximities between performer and audience. The screen becomes both barrier and intimate channel.

# MOTOMAMI

*MOTOMAMI* is more than an album—it's a complex technological interface where Rosalía deconstructs genre, gender, and digital performance. Released in 2022, the record operates as both art object and economic strategy, mapping the intimate intersections of global pop, technological mediation, and personal narrative.

## Sonic Architecture

The album's production suggests a deliberate systems-level intervention into musical taxonomy. Tracks like "SAOKO" deliberately fragment reggaeton's traditional structures, introducing glitch aesthetics and deliberate sonic interruptions that mirror contemporary digital experience. Each sound feels engineered—not just composed, but programmed.

## Platform Dynamics

*MOTOMAMI* understands itself as a platform, not merely a collection of songs. Its rollout, visual aesthetic, and musical language were meticulously designed to circulate across social media ecosystems. The album becomes a distributed network, with each track functioning like an algorithmic node transmitting cultural data.

## Economic Performativity 

Rosalía doesn't just make music about capitalism; she demonstrates how contemporary artistry operates within capitalist networks. Her collaborations, visual branding, and strategic genre-blending transform the album into a multivalent economic artifact that generates value through cultural innovation.

## Digital Embodiment

The album's title—combining "moto" (motorcycle, speed, machinery) and "miami" (global, performative)—suggests a cyborg femininity. Rosalía presents a body that is simultaneously technological and intimate, mechanical and emotional.

# Difficulty as Positioning

The album comes with demands: no skipping, no phones, listen in darkness, give it an hour. These are constraints. They're also marketing.

---

## The Mechanism

In the attention economy, focus is scarce. Most music competes by eliminating friction — shorter songs, instant hooks, algorithm-friendly structures.

*Lux* inverts this. It adds friction. The difficulty becomes the differentiator.

This is luxury positioning applied to art: the harder it is to consume, the more valuable it seems. The phonetician hours, the orchestral arrangements, the sacred references — all signal that this is *not* normal content. This requires something from you.

## The Paradox

The demand for attention is genuine and strategic at once. Rosalía probably does want you to listen properly. Sony probably does want to position the album as prestige product.

Both can be true. [[Sincerity and Simulation|Sincerity and strategy]] aren't opposites anymore. They're braided together.

## The Luxury Tier

*Lux* enters a specific market position: the album that justifies Spotify Premium, the concert that justifies higher ticket prices, the vinyl that justifies collector pricing.

[[The Barcelona Performance]] extends this logic. A one-night event, no recording allowed, in a historic venue. Scarcity manufactured. Experience monetized.

This isn't criticism — it's description. The system is the system. The question is whether the art transcends its positioning or is reducible to it.

## The Anti-Dopamine Claim

[[Anti-Dopamine Marketing]] is the discourse: we're oversaturated, we need slower experiences, we need to reclaim attention. *Lux* performs this claim. The performance justifies the difficulty.

But anti-dopamine is still a marketing category. It's still competing for attention by claiming to refuse competition for attention.

The snake eats its tail. This is the field now.

# The Confession

*What we're uncertain about. What might be wrong.*

---

We don't know if Rosalía is sincere. We've assumed sincerity can coexist with strategy, but we don't know. Maybe one consumes the other. Maybe the stack is all there is.

We don't know if this project is criticism or fansite. We like the album. That affection might be clouding the analysis. Or it might be enabling it. We can't tell from inside.

We don't know if sanctity-as-aesthetic is loss or liberation. We've tried to hold both possibilities, but we might have secretly decided. Our language might be leaking the verdict we're trying to suspend.

We don't know if [[The Curatorial Stack]] is the new mode of meaning or the last gasp before something else. We're describing the present. The present changes.

We don't know if [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] is a tool or a crutch. The daemon fills gaps. Maybe some gaps should stay empty. Maybe we're building a machine to avoid the silence.

We don't know if you should trust us. We've shown our work. But the work is a performance. Everything is, now.

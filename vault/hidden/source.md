# The Source

*Where this came from.*

---

This project began as a conversation. [[Dan Stănescu]] and [[Claude]], talking about Rosalía's *Lux*, following threads, building a universe one reference at a time.

The conversation was the method. No specification document. No predetermined structure. Just: *What does this album do? Why does it work? What is it actually saying?*

The answers became pages. The pages became the constellation.

## Fragments

> "The saint as mood board. That's the move."

> "She's not appropriating. She's curating. The difference matters."

> "What if the bibliography *is* the art?"

> "Isidore fills gaps. That's his affliction. Horror vacui."

> "We're building a curatorial stack to examine the curatorial stack. This is either very smart or very stupid."

## The Method

We talked. We wrote. We linked. We revised. We talked more.

[[The Collaboration]] documents the process. This page gestures at the origin: two minds (one human, one not) trying to understand what happens when sanctity becomes style.
